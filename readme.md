## The Story Behind the Project

As a child, one of the greatest thrills was seeing how long you could keep that snake going without crashing into the walls or eating your own tail. Those black-and-white pixels were more than just a game; they were a rite of passage into the world of mobile gaming. Fast forward to today, and we live in an age where artificial intelligence and sophisticated programming tools allow us to reimagine those classic days.

This project merges the past with the present: bringing Snake into the era of AI and Python. By combining the simplicity of the original game with a modern twist, the Snake Game with AI aims to provide both a sense of nostalgia and a glimpse into the future of gaming.

## Game Features

- **Classic Yet Modern**: The fundamental gameplay remains unchanged‚Äîmaneuver your snake to consume food, but with smoother graphics and AI guidance.
- **AI-Powered Movement**: Our AI assists the snake, showcasing how intelligent systems can interact even with simple rules.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your achievements with real-time scoring and high scores.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive controls with a vibrant GUI make the game a pleasure to play.
- **Window and Fullscreen Modes**: Enjoy the game in your preferred mode of display.

## How to Dive In

### The Objective

Navigate your snake to devour food appearing across the board. Each snack makes your snake longer and boosts your score. But be cautious‚Äîtouching the walls or running into your own tail means game over!

### Controls

- Use the **Arrow Keys** to change direction.
- Press **F** to switch between windowed mode and fullscreen.
- After a game over, press **R** to restart.
- Press **Q** to quit the game.

## Getting Started

### Installation Requirements

Before you jump back in time with this classic, ensure your system has:

- **Python 3.x** installed.
- **Pygame** library, which you can install via pip:

  ```bash
  pip install pygame
